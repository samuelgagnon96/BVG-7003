# BVG-7003
This document was produced during my BVG-7003 class at Laval University. This class is about bioinformatic tools and how to properly use them in our own study. 
For this project, we had to write coding lines based on our notes on the basic functions on Python and Biopython. 
This guide could be useful for all new programmer who wants to learn the basics of Python and Biopython.

We used Pycharm to write and run the scripts, so the first step is to download Pycharm on your computer. Here's the link for the free version of Pycharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac

Once you have Pycharm Downloaded, make sure that you are running the lateast version or Python on your Pycharm. The latest version when i ran my scritps was 3.10.

To Run the Biopython scripts, you'll have to install some packages in Pycharm. Those are the packages you'll need for this project: numpy, biopython, matplolib and pylablib.

All the scripts are working, the only issue if you want to run them is that you'll need to change the various trajectories to your own on your computer. 

If you have any issues or questions about this scripts or those tools you can join me by email on: samuel.gagnon.19@ulaval.ca

Have a nice programming session.
