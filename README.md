# BVG-7003
This document was produced during my BVG-7003 class at Laval University. This class is about bioinformatic tools and how to properly use them in our own study. 

The first project concerned Python and BioPython. 
For this project, we had to write coding lines based on our notes on the basic functions on Python and Biopython. The file Python.sh shows the python scripts and Biopython.sh file shows the biopython scripts.
This guide could be useful for all new programmer who wants to learn the basics of Python and Biopython.

We used Pycharm to write and run the scripts, so the first step is to download Pycharm on your computer. Here's the link for the free version of Pycharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac

Once you have Pycharm Downloaded, make sure that you are running the lateast version or Python on your Pycharm. The latest version when i ran my scritps was 3.10.

To Run the Biopython scripts, you'll have to install some packages in Pycharm. Those are the packages you'll need for this project: numpy, biopython, matplolib and pylablib.


The second project was about GWAS and how to use the tools to work with the genotypic data. This project is divided in many smaller scripts that represent every step of the process. 
This project was run on the NARVAL server explaining why some lines in the scripts explain how to install the different tools in this new environment. 

The sabre.sh files includes the scripts to sort the sequences accroding to their barcodes.


All the scripts are working, the only issue if you want to run them is that you'll need to change the various trajectories to your own on your computer. 

If you have any issues or questions about this scripts or those tools you can join me by email on: samuel.gagnon.19@ulaval.ca

Have a nice programming session.
